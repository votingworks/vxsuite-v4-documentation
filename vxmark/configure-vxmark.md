# Configure VxMark

The following steps must be completed by an Election Manager.

Before you configure VxMark, you must setup the machine. Follow [VxMark Hardware Setup](vxmark-hardware-setup.md) steps.

To configure **VxMark**, you must do two things in **VxAdmin**:

1. [Save the election package](../user-manual/vxadmin-system-setup/save-election-package.md) to a USB drive.
2. [Create an Election Manager Card](../user-manual/vxadmin-system-setup/programming-cards.md).

## Ports

Under the accessible controller is the smart card reader.&#x20;

The smart card reader is under the accessible controller.

The USB port is accessible at the ballot box attachment point. The ballot box must be removed to insert a USB drive. Seal and document the ballot box as required.

## Loading The Election Package

An unconfigured machine will prompt you to insert an Election Manager Card to log in and then a USB drive with the election package saved from VxAdmin to configure.&#x20;

After the USB drive is inserted, VxMark will automatically begin loading all ballot styles for the election. After the election package is done loading, the Election Manager Settings screen will display in Test Ballot Mode.

## Setting Mode

Use the toggle button to switch between _`Test Ballot Mode`_ and _`Official Ballot Mode`_. The machine must be in Official Ballot Mode on Election Day.  Review the [L\&A Overview instructions](../logic-and-accuracy-pre-election-testing/l-and-a-overview.md) to understand which mode to use during L\&A testing.

To remove election configuration (and all data) from VxMark:

* [ ] Insert an Election Manager Card
* [ ] Select _`Unconfigure Machine`_.
